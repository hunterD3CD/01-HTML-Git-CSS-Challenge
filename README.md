06: in the "content" section, in order to build a logic structure, change div to article.
because the style of the three contents are the same, we can merge it into one. the image height can be under the same content. the h2 can be under the same content as well.
rename the div to "content-text text-right". it helps us to have a better understanding in CSS file.
in CSS file, change margin for content to "0 auto 20px 30px"
